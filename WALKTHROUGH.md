# IMPCTFUL Demo Walkthrough

## Kickstarter Launch Analytics

The Kickstarter Launch Analytics dashboard simulates a command center for a live crowdfunding campaign. It demonstrates how IMPCTFUL ingests platform data to provide actionable agency-grade insights.

### How to Demo
1. **Navigate to Dashboard**: Go to the main "Agency Home" dashboard.
2. **Enable Demo Mode**: Toggle the "Demo Mode" switch in the top right.
3. **Select Archetype**: Click the archetype selector (dropdown next to Demo toggle) and choose **"Kickstarter Launch"**.
4. **View Dashboard**: The dashboard automatically loads with a simulated "Day 6" dataset showing strong 'Custom' channel performance.

### Key Demo Points
- **Executive Scoreboard**: Point out the "Source Split" bar showing the ratio of Kickstarter Organic vs. External traffic. This highlights the agency's impact.
- **Momentum Chart**: Show the "Day 4" spike in the chart, explaining how the AI attributes this to a specific PR event (TechCrunch) in the Weekly Review.
- **Leaderboard**: Highlight the "Quality" column which auto-flags high-value traffic sources.
- **AI Situation Report**: Read the "What Happened" section to show how we synthesize data into narrative, removing the need for clients to decipher raw CSVs.

### Interactive Elements
- **CSV Upload**: You can click "Upload Kickstarter Referrers CSV" to ingest a real file. The dashboard parses standard Kickstarter export headers (`Referrer`, `Pledged`, `Pledges`).
- **Reset**: If a custom file is loaded, a "Reset" button appears to return to the perfect demo state.
